# Variables

All high-level programming languages use data types for variables, but those data types are not always the same.

For example, Java uses a combination of `int`, `byte`, `short` and `long` for integers. 

Python only uses `int`.

Python has 4 "Primitive" data types and 4 "Non-Primitive" data types.

The difference between Primitive and Non-Primitive becomes more apparent once you get to actually using them, but the main idea is: **Non-Primitive data types store Primitive data within them.**

### Why do I need to know this?

It's always important to understand how different data types work and interact with each other in order to effectively use them. For example, when is it better to use a list vs when to use a tuple or a set? By learning about each data type, you'll get a cleaner understanding of when to use which.
