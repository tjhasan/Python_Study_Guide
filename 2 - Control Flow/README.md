# Control Flow

"Control flow", as the name suggests, are tools that are used to control the flow of the code. For example if you want a specific section of code to only run if a certain condition is met, or you want to run a specific section of code to run multiple times. 

There are many ways to control code execution in Python:

* `If` / `elif` / `else`
* `for` / `for each` / `while` loops
* `switch` cases

You will learn each of the above as well as the intricacies of each.
